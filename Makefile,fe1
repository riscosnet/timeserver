# To export to the standard C: path, you might use an export like:

# Export rules
# For any files you export with EXPORTS you may need to include an
# export rule
# To export bare files you can use the ${CP} command:
# ${EXP_LIB}.${COMPONENT}.h.myheader: h.myheader
#        ${CP} $?  $@  ${CPFLAGS}

cleantarget:
           ${RM} h.cmodulehdr
# This clean target removes any module header file that was built.
